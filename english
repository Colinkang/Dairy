A good practice is if you have a favorite movie or TV show,
and you watch like your favorite 10 minutes part,10 minutes of it,
and watch it so many times that you know what everyone is going to say,
and then you should turn down the volume,and try to sound just like those people,
try to imitate the people,(imitate),yes yes,do your best,that is a good way
to reduce your accent,change your accent,because you were trying to sound just
like the people in the movie,and if you do that often，when you say those words,
you will say it that way without your accent.
一种很好的练习方式就是选一个自己最喜欢的电影或者电视剧,比如你可以挑你最
喜欢的10分钟片段来看，电影片段的10分钟,然后你反复多次看直到你记住了所有人要说的话。
然后你应该调低音量，努力说的跟电影里的人一模一样，尝试去模仿他们，（模仿），是的，没错,
不断完善，尽力模仿到最像，那是减少、改掉你的口音的一个很好方式，因为你在努力说得跟电影里的
人一模一样，只要你经常这么练习,当你说这些话时，你就可以用地道的、没有自己口音的方式说出来。
